1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,060
IDI for so the first question I just like to start off by learning a little more about you

2
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:20,160
and your work so can you tell me about your role and typical responsibilities in your health care

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:42,720
facility. My role as obstetrician is to help the patients who come for ANC checkup to see that the pregnancy is carried out safely throughout and they have a safe confinement and as a gynecologist to cater for any health care issues of the other women in the reproductive or post reproductive age.

4
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,120
Perfect. And how long have you been in this position?

5
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,320
In this present working place, I have been here since four years.

6
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,100
Okay. And what types of patients do you most often see?

7
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:59,180
Most often I see ANC patients. Okay. And of course patients in the reproductive age group.

8
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,980
Okay. And what types of health issues, so in your case women's health issues, do you most commonly see?

9
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:13,820
Apart from agrarian cancer checkup, women do come to me with white discharge and irregular bleeding.

10
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:22,460
I see. And where does cervical cancer screening fall on that list of health issues that women come with?

11
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,900
I didn't get you.

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,260
So do women also come with cervical cancer or symptoms of cervical cancer?

13
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,340
Yeah, they do come with the symptoms.

14
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:39,560
And what types of services do you provide for the health issues you said? Whether it's white discharge or anything like that, what treatment do you offer them?

15
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:49,860
First I just examine them and to see. If there's an infection, I do treat them locally. And if the symptoms do persist, I just offer them a screening for cancer.

16
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,080
Even otherwise regularly, I do offer them a screening.

17
00:01:52,080 --> 00:02:01,920
Okay. And now going a little bit more into cervical cancer specifically, are you involved in cervical cancer screening and treatment?

18
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,040
Yeah, I'm involved.

19
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:12,700
Okay. And how much did your medical training cover cervical cancer? Was it a lot in your training or did you learn more through experience?

20
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,920
It was more with experience only.

21
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,260
Okay.

22
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,880
You mean to say in the college days.

23
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,280
Yeah.

24
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,740
Yeah, not much exposure there.

25
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:26,180
Okay. Was there any formal continued medical education that helped in learning more or it was mostly just experience?

26
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,900
Yeah, yeah, of course. Country medical education. We attend CME and other things.

27
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,200
Okay.

28
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:30,960
They do help.

29
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:41,640
Wonderful. So, with that being said, are you aware of any formal training opportunities like CME for cervical cancer specifically, cervical cancer screening?

30
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,880
Any particular CME training for that?

31
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,460
Training, yeah.

32
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,540
No, I haven't done any particular training for that.

33
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:55,500
Okay. So, would you say that these types of trainings about cervical cancer are accessible for you or your colleagues or they're not as common?

34
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,580
They're accessible.

35
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,440
They're accessible.

36
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:06,580
They're accessible. Okay. Wonderful. So, getting more into the prevention and treatment, do you provide any prevention or treatment services for cervical cancer?

37
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,400
Prevention, actually screening will be done. That's a sort of prevention only because early detection will help the treatment to prevent the cancer.

38
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:15,940
Absolutely.

39
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,220
And recently the government is initiating a drive to vaccinate all the girls aged from 9 to 14.

40
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:21,560
Yeah.

41
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,560
So, that needs to be implemented yet.

42
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,080
Absolutely.

43
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,040
Even otherwise, if any patients are willing, I do advise them to go for other places to get the vaccine done.

44
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,820
Okay. And any treatment?

45
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:40,000
Treatment in earlier I used to practice in a private training. They used to give this, I used to do biopsy and cryotherapy once or twice have done.

46
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,520
Okay.

47
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,520
Not much than that.

48
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,360
But not here?

49
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,960
Not here. Here it's not done.

50
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:50,280
So, for screening specifically, is it offered to everyone or only if they have symptoms?

51
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,220
Screening I do offer for everyone.

52
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:52,640
Okay.

53
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,520
But not all undergo screening.

54
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:54,820
Yeah.

55
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:54,840
Yeah.

56
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,320
That makes sense.

57
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:05,020
And so, once they come to you for screening, what do the next steps look like? Whether they're negative or positive, what happens next?

58
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:17,620
If they're negative, then as they get it repeated for every year for three years, three consecutive years. Then if they're negative, it's fine. In case if they're positive, then I just refer them to higher symptoms.

59
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,480
Higher symptoms.

60
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,360
Medical quality here.

61
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:27,780
I see. I see. Got it. And do you only really screen when they show symptoms or do you screen regular, routinely?

62
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:36,020
Actually, patients do come to when they have symptoms. Otherwise, even if they offer, they won't be willing to get it screened.

63
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:43,700
Yeah. Got it. So, how many women who screen positive come back for follow-up or go to the next level for follow-up?

64
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,020
So far, I haven't seen any patient coming back to me.

65
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,020
Okay. No patients.

66
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,300
No one has come.

67
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,400
So, do you feel that enough women are getting follow-up or no?

68
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,720
Enough women, they are not getting follow-up, I think.

69
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,660
Okay. Okay. Got it.

70
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,720
So, once their symptoms fade off, then probably they'll be happy sitting at home.

71
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,540
I see. Don't come back.

72
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,840
Okay. And if their symptoms don't fade off, then you think...

73
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,860
Then they do come.

74
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,500
They do come.

75
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:09,820
They do come.

76
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,860
They come back to you or they go to the next...

77
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,520
They do come to me and then I advise them to go to the higher center.

78
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,120
Higher center.

79
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,180
And I don't know if you know this, but do they generally end up going to the higher center

80
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,940
or do you feel they don't end up going?

81
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,260
Some might go. Some will go. Some won't.

82
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,300
Okay. Okay.

83
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,020
Any amount or rate you feel or just generally some go, some don't go?

84
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,700
Like any number of women, you think 50 or so?

85
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,760
I'm not sure. I'm not sure.

86
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,300
No worries.

87
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,160
Is there anything that you do that will increase the chances of a woman following up?

88
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,940
Is there anything you say to them or do for them that you think will help them go?

89
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,900
I think a regular follow-up with Asha Varkas might help.

90
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,040
Okay. Okay.

91
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,520
So, same question.

92
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,760
Is there anything you would like to do or would be helpful to improve screening and follow-up amongst women?

93
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,980
I think health education.

94
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,600
Okay.

95
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,420
Regular health education monthly.

96
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:00,980
Got it.

97
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,020
And awareness might help.

98
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:08,060
And any ways you feel the best way to do that, awareness or health education?

99
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,500
Is there any specific way to increase the education?

100
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,800
Increase education.

101
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,220
I think the Asha Varkas, they will be the best persons to motivate women to ask them to come to me.

102
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,540
So that I can educate them.

103
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,780
Otherwise, I can't go to their door and ask them to come.

104
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,100
So, obviously, when they come here, I can educate them.

105
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:27,920
I see.

106
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,900
So, you think that it's important for women to come to the stage?

107
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,020
To come to the facility.

108
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,660
To come to the facility.

109
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,160
I see.

110
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,260
That makes a lot of sense.

111
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:39,620
Okay.

112
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:47,860
And then the next question is going into learning more about the CHC specifically and how the CHC works with cervical cancer treatment.

113
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:58,240
So, the first question is just how do you receive the equipment and supplies such as the pap smear kits or the colposcopy tools, whatever you might use.

114
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,380
How do you receive them to conduct the screening and follow-up?

115
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,900
Is it like a government gives you or what is the process?

116
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,640
At present only, I am doing VIA.

117
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,260
Okay.

118
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,640
So, usually, especially with acetic acid.

119
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:08,980
Okay.

120
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,040
So, corpus commandos is not available here.

121
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,340
Okay.

122
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:11,760
Okay.

123
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,080
So, how do you receive the VIA?

124
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,900
Usually, through the government.

125
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:14,580
Government.

126
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,260
And is everyone trained on the VIA or just?

127
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,000
No, not.

128
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,140
VIA, not.

129
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,940
I don't think everyone is trained.

130
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:21,420
Okay.

131
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,960
So, just you as the gynecologist can do VIA?

132
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,360
The nursing staff or anything?

133
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,060
Nursing staff, yeah.

134
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,320
If I train them, they can do.

135
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:27,680
Okay.

136
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,060
They do assistment, they can do.

137
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,560
Okay.

138
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,900
But they don't, okay, got it.

139
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,880
So, comes from the government, got it.

140
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,060
Yeah.

141
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,660
And then, do you have to work with any pathology or lab services then?

142
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,860
But if you don't do biopsy or pap smears, is there anything else you have to send to the lab?

143
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,820
Yeah, our lab technician, she doesn't study the smear.

144
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,260
Okay.

145
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,940
So, we have to send the smear to my medical college.

146
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,360
Okay.

147
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,120
So, you do do the smear here, the pap smear?

148
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,940
Sometimes I do.

149
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,380
Okay.

150
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,820
And what, how do you decide if you'll do pap smear or if you'll do VIA?

151
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,300
Like, which one do you choose based on what options?

152
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,480
Actually, VIA is much easier to do.

153
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:03,760
Yeah.

154
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,720
And it carries a lot more convenience.

155
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,300
Okay.

156
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,620
So, if people are willing for pap smear, then I'll do that.

157
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:09,980
Okay.

158
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,480
But otherwise, normally you do?

159
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,120
Normally, VIA.

160
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:12,600
VIA.

161
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,000
Okay.

162
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,680
And is it a cost difference or anything or it's the same?

163
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,520
That pap smears and VIA are equally accessible?

164
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
Yeah.

165
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,280
More than cost difference, it's the convenience.

166
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,280
Okay.

167
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,280
Like, perhaps you have to take the smear, then the labor attendants into the lab.

168
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
Yeah.

169
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,280
Then you have to follow it up.

170
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
Yeah.

171
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
I see.

172
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:38,040
So, actually based on that, because you're absolutely correct, that it takes some time

173
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,040
when you send to the lab and you get results.

174
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,040
So, does that time, does that get extended and women stop following up?

175
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,800
Yeah, yeah.

176
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Maybe.

177
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
That happens sometimes.

178
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Okay.

179
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
So, there's a time gap in between the pathology services.

180
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Yeah, there's a time gap.

181
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Okay.

182
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Got it.

183
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,300
So, if you send a smear, how long does it take for the report to come back?

184
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,560
A few days, maybe.

185
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,040
Okay.

186
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,860
A few days.

187
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,860
Got it.

188
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:09,160
But, do you think the time affects the woman's willingness to get treated?

189
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,800
Like, longer times affect whether women will come back?

190
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,940
Not all, but some.

191
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,940
Yeah.

192
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,940
Yeah.

193
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,940
Makes sense.

194
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,940
Absolutely.

195
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,940
So, these questions are a bit repetitive, the next ones, but I'll just ask them.

196
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,940
Do you have the resources here to conduct treatment services for HPV infection or precancerous

197
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,940
lesions, such as cryotherapy, LEAP or thermal ablation?

198
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,940
We don't have any resources.

199
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,940
No.

200
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,940
Yes.

201
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,180
And, same question, a little repetitive, is resources to conduct treatment services for

202
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,940
cervical cancer, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy?

203
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,940
No.

204
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,940
I think, in this aspect, we need to be trained.

205
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,940
Training is necessary.

206
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,940
Absolutely.

207
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,940
So, actually, that's a good segue.

208
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:51,940
Next question is, do you feel that your facility has, the CHC has enough medical personnel,

209
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,940
so nurses, doctors, staff, trained to work on preventing and treating cervical cancer?

210
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,940
At present, we're getting the staff recently due to transfer, so I've got a few more staff.

211
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,940
Okay.

212
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,940
So, I think now we may be able to do that.

213
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,940
I see.

214
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,940
But, what about the training instead of the number of people?

215
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,940
Training is necessary.

216
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,940
Absolutely necessary.

217
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,940
Absolutely.

218
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:23,940
licence

219
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,940
The story is happening in Victoria.

220
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,940
Yes.

221
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,940
Absolutely.

222
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:33,160
To what about the labor and the mental elements by KJ that we are doing doing something like

223
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,160
you that we have them as well.

224
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,260
I'm saying it doesn't matter.

225
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,260
Yes.

226
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:50,120
just go back sorry so we were just talking a little bit about training so

227
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,740
if you have any more thoughts on what does more training look like where do

228
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,700
you want to see more training whether it's it's for screening treatment or

229
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,320
just knowledge what does training look like I think training should be more

230
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,780
regarding knowledge and the treatment for screening anybody can do yeah screening

231
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:12,080
everyone can if we can do for treatment every time they need to go to higher

232
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,500
center so that will be difficult for the local local it's yeah so if the

233
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,820
difference might available locally certainly more helpful I think absolutely

234
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,420
that makes that makes sense so do you think that means that they you need more

235
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:29,240
gynecologists or you need more training for like nurses and staff so available

236
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,420
gynecologists and nurses can be trained if they're trained well enough that will be

237
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:40,220
more helpful okay okay so next question is going more into the CHC because you

238
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,460
must have to work with other facilities like you said you refer them to the

239
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:48,980
higher center so how would how does the referral process work between the CHC and

240
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,300
yourself and the higher centers or even the PHC ASHA workers how do you

241
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,740
communicate with them in case if I find a patient positive like I'll refer a

242
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,880
direct to the medical college for treatment and in case if I if ASHA knows

243
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,540
her well then I can follow her up with sending the ASHA like I'll collect the ASHA's number

244
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,680
they'll have it they'll see to it that she's getting her treatment there regularly

245
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,340
otherwise sometimes there are chances of missing a patient yeah if they're not from

246
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:19,680
this local area they're from other places I obviously do okay so the ASHA worker you

247
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,520
contact the ASHA worker who follows up with the patient on whether the patient is

248
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,460
getting their treatment from the higher center yeah so it's like us like a

249
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:34,200
multiple people multiple people I see and what about between the the yourself and the higher

250
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,280
center is there how do you communicate and contact the higher center oh obviously with

251
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:43,020
the written notes only I can just write my findings and add them to the needful I see so

252
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,220
sometimes getting the feedback will be difficult directly from them I see so the written notes

253
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,180
go through the patient or you send it directly to the higher center yeah unless I know the doctor

254
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:56,100
there okay so if there are many acquaintances or friends I can follow them up otherwise I'll just

255
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:02,100
have to get the help of the ASHA workers of the ASHA workers so with that being said then is is it

256
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:08,220
difficult to get the is it difficult to get the patient to the higher center

257
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,140
occasionally or is that mostly the ASHA workers job to see that the patient goes to

258
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,660
the no no sometimes if there is a absolute necessity the patients will

259
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,000
voluntarily go into the higher center only follow-up needs to be done okay though not all

260
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,520
maybe really few will definitely go okay got it and then in order to for you to keep track of the

261
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:35,100
patients you contact the ASHA workers so what tends to what works well in between working with

262
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,020
the ASHA workers and the higher set the higher center like how do you make sure the process is smooth

263
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:46,020
like ASHA workers act like mediators so the they are in good contact with the patient since they

264
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:54,420
said locally I see so I think they're the better process to convince them okay makes sense and so

265
00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:01,500
do you feel there's a shared understanding so between the all the levels ASHA worker PHC CHC of

266
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:07,620
cervical care and do they all you know do they all give importance to cervical cancer or do you feel

267
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,860
it's it's different on different not not the same not the same okay so in what ways do you think it's

268
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:20,380
different at which level is it is it more maybe more important and at which levels is maybe it's

269
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:28,620
given less importance for cervical cancer if that makes sense like I did first the patient I need to

270
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,540
understand the seriousness of her symptoms yeah then she needs the ASHA worker needs to bring her here

271
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:41,220
then I get her exam and she had to take her for follow then get her treated so it's a long process

272
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:46,320
yeah so there will anyway chances of missing the patient in between or the treatment may be discontinued

273
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:53,220
I see so I think equally healthy education is always equally important so we have to create an

274
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:58,140
awareness among the women who are in the reproductive age group and let them understand the importance of

275
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,140
of the cervical cancer screening so then only we can screen and send them

276
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:11,140
I see absolutely and so sorry back to the shared understanding do you feel that the that

277
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:17,880
cervical cancer is given importance within the healthcare system so for example at the PHC or the CHC or the

278
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,640
higher center is it given more importance if a patient goes to the higher center versus if they go to the

279
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,080
PHC or you think they are all the levels give cervical cancer equal importance that it's an important

280
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:39,080
higher center I guess so based on this final on this part is what are some challenges that you're that the

281
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:45,080
patients face when they have to go to a different level of care so the higher center or even speak to

282
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:52,080
their ASHA what some issues they might have going to the higher center access will be the main issue I think because in a local

283
00:15:52,080 --> 00:16:03,080
healthcare center like that the doctors and staff are easily accessible for them so in a higher center they'll be they're not knowing where to go whom to approach so that difficulty they might face

284
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:17,080
I see and if you don't mind expanding a little more on what access so because I'm not entirely familiar with the higher center so what makes it difficult to access the center is it just they're not familiar or it's busy things like that

285
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:28,080
such a big hospital they're not familiar with whom to contact whom not to and many won't be educated also so in a big hospital they find difficult to find the right person to contact the right person

286
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:34,080
I see even if you refer them and you give them a referral to the higher center they'll struggle to find the

287
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:46,080
sometimes they might struggle not all but some uneducated people and all they might struggle I see generally what are they supposed to do so when you refer them to the higher center what is the patient supposed to do when they go there are they supposed to find the

288
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:53,080
are they supposed to find the doctor themselves or you give them the doctor's name or how does it work we don't usually give them a doctor's name because the unit

289
00:16:53,080 --> 00:17:01,080
you mentioned only there are separate units yeah so each day will be assigned to a different unit so we won't be knowing which unit will be working that particular day I see

290
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:11,080
so you just ask them to go to the OPD and give them the FLS name okay okay so they have to approach the doctor themselves okay I see so do you feel that makes it more difficult for them

291
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:23,080
maybe difficult sometimes okay versus in the CHC because this is the community do you feel feel the CHC makes it easier for them to to come in and get treatment versus the higher

292
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:38,080
center yeah this might be a bit easier compared to that and why why is that why because this setup will be closer to the place where they reside and there the people will be more accessible to them as I said earlier and the cost of traveling community is more accessible to them

293
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:45,080
as I said earlier and the cost of traveling commuting and that will be saved absolutely and also time

294
00:17:45,080 --> 00:18:06,080
yeah that makes sense actually that's a good into my next question is are there any societal or cultural factors that impact whether women follow up on survival cancer care so anything society's things or cultural that stops them from seeking care or changes how they seek care I don't think so okay okay so

295
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:13,080
maybe like education awareness you had mentioned yeah but anything like family

296
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:19,080
support perspectives anything like social that changes their mind social like lower

297
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:33,080
social economic curve people might find it difficult because husbands many times they won't be drunk or they won't support their family so women have to earn themselves they have to look after their families so sometimes they might find it difficult otherwise no other cultural

298
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:40,080
intelligence I think okay only social economic maybe okay so there's no cultural perspective against cervical cancer you feel in what

299
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:48,080
cultural perspective just if if women are scared some people are scared of the word cancer so some women don't pursue treatment for that reason but I don't if only if you feel like it all depends on how you convince them like we don't put the word cancer directly into their head I just tell you that we are getting a screening test done I see not necessarily that patient should have had the cancer

300
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:55,080
okay just a screen test to find it out okay so that words might put some solace into them and they might be good okay we will need to go

301
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:02,080
got it so what about financial constraints do you feel the finances will change whether or not they follow up on care

302
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:19,080
yeah definitely okay is treatment expensive treatment in a government hospital is not expensive okay so then how come finances will impact just because it's still too expensive finance in the sense as i said

303
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,080
Is treatment expensive?

304
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,080
Treatment in government hospitals is not expensive.

305
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,080
So then how come finances will impact? Just because it's still too expensive?

306
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:35,080
Finance in the sense, as I said, in many households women will be working both outside and inside the home.

307
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,080
So one day going for treatment again, that day's expense will be...

308
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,080
They have to bed on the hunter. They won't be able to go to the work also.

309
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:50,080
So if they sit at home and go for treatment for a couple of days, then the family will be difficult.

310
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,080
That way it will be affected.

311
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,080
I see. So it's more about the expenses that are missing.

312
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,080
That's missing, yeah.

313
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,080
I understand.

314
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
I mean they won't be able to earn that amount for that particular day.

315
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,080
I understand. Got it.

316
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:08,080
And what about transportation? So reaching the facility to get the care, does that become...

317
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,080
Transportation at present, due to Siddhra Mai's government, all buses, they take the women free only.

318
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,080
Oh.

319
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,080
So transportation won't be...

320
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,080
Okay. So you feel that transporting to the higher centre is...

321
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,080
It's not a problem.

322
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Okay, got it. How close is the higher centre to the CHC?

323
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,080
To this place around 15 kilometres, I guess. 15, 20 kilometres. 15 maybe.

324
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,080
Okay, wow. So that's...

325
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,080
15, 20, yeah.

326
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,080
Yeah.

327
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,080
Women are willing to make the...

328
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,080
Yeah.

329
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,080
Okay. So there's no issues in them, like, wanting to go.

330
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,080
No issues.

331
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,080
Just the financial thing becomes...

332
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,080
Yeah, only the financial thing becomes interesting.

333
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,080
I see.

334
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,080
So, and you mentioned this as well, but does the way that healthcare providers, like medical

335
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,080
providers like yourself, speak to the patients and speak about cervical cancer impact whether

336
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,080
or not they choose to follow up on care?

337
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
Yeah, definitely.

338
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,080
Okay.

339
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,080
And how so?

340
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,080
How so, like, we have to let them...

341
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,080
We have to make them be aware of the health issues they are facing.

342
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
Mm-hm.

343
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:14,080
And, like, since cervical cancer is a preventable one, we have to make them realize that treatment

344
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,080
prevention is equally important.

345
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,080
Mm-hm.

346
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,080
And so, if they are at good health, they can take care of their family well.

347
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,080
So you have to put that concept into their mind.

348
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,080
Mm-hm.

349
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,080
Got it.

350
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:30,080
So, compared to how we are speaking to women today and now, is there any way to improve

351
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,080
the way that we speak to them so that they will follow up on care?

352
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,080
Sorry.

353
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,080
I didn't...

354
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,080
Sorry, I didn't...

355
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,080
Any improvements we can make to encourage them to follow up on care when we speak to

356
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,080
them?

357
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,080
Yeah.

358
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,080
Whether it's, you said awareness, so that one I noted down, increasing awareness, anything

359
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,080
else, whether it's consolation, counselling, anything like that?

360
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,080
Yeah, you think...

361
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,080
Counseling might help.

362
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,080
Okay.

363
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,080
Counseling and regular screening camps.

364
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,080
Mm-hm.

365
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,080
Once in three months, once in six months.

366
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,080
That might help.

367
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,080
Okay.

368
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,080
So, once one who I miss, they will come to a screening for the next camp.

369
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,080
Mm-hm.

370
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,080
Screening at least twice a year.

371
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,080
Mm-hm.

372
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,080
That might help.

373
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,080
Okay.

374
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,080
Regular screening in all villages.

375
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,080
Yeah.

376
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
Regular screening.

377
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,080
Wonderful.

378
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:17,080
So, then we're nearing the end, but this is more looking into the future and take your time

379
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,080
to think about it, but if you were able to make one or two changes to improve cervical

380
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:30,080
cancer screening in your facility or in the CSC or in this district, what would they be?

381
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,080
One thing is a mandatory vaccination for all girls, teenage girls.

382
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,080
Then compassive screening.

383
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,080
That's the only thing I would recommend.

384
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,080
Okay.

385
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,080
So, when there's mass screening and it's free of cost, then obviously if one woman goes,

386
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,080
other women will follow her.

387
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,080
And what is the best way to do that?

388
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,080
How do you get these women to these mass screenings?

389
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,080
Is it holding them in the CSC or going into the community?

390
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,080
How do you suggest doing it?

391
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,080
Going into the community can be done through ASHA workers.

392
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,080
They have to get their patients.

393
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,080
I see.

394
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,080
So, but ASHA workers are not trained on cervical cancer screening.

395
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,080
They're not trained.

396
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,080
Right.

397
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,080
So, instead do you suggest training them or bringing them, having them bring the patients to

398
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,080
the...

399
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,080
Let them bring the patients.

400
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,080
That will be better.

401
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,080
So, and bring them to the CSC.

402
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,080
The CSC.

403
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,080
Right.

404
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,080
Because even the two houses, they won't be able to screen them there.

405
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,080
That won't be possible.

406
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,080
Yeah.

407
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,080
So, then what about changes to improve follow-up and treatment?

408
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,080
So, not screening, but following up and making sure women, because a lot of women end

409
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,080
up not, you know, you had mentioned not all women go to the higher center.

410
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,080
So, how can we improve and make sure they go to the higher center?

411
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:46,080
I think once we screen a certain list of patients, we have to note down their attention number.

412
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,080
And once you come positive, you can follow them up.

413
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,080
By regular health staff or I can call them myself.

414
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
I see.

415
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:58,080
Because a few patients around my working place, it won't be much difficult, I think.

416
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
Yeah.

417
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,080
Got it.

418
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,080
And so, you feel that, you feel that that will help if the doctor speaks to them directly,

419
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,080
that it will have a stronger...

420
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,080
Yeah.

421
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,080
It will help them.

422
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,080
It will boost their confidence.

423
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,080
I see.

424
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
Got it.

425
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:19,080
And any innovation that you feel could significantly improve patient outcomes in the CHC?

426
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:25,080
So, whether it's any technology or education that would make cervical cancer screening and

427
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,080
treatment better here.

428
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:32,080
But I think all, like I said, as a working gynecologist here, I think in Mysore there

429
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,080
are many gynecologists, but we are made to concentrate more on ANCs.

430
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,080
Yeah.

431
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,080
Like antenatal obstetricians.

432
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,080
Yeah.

433
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,080
We concentrate more on obstetrics rather than gynecology.

434
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,080
So, I think we, people need regular training in treatment.

435
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,080
Yes.

436
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,080
Like cryotherapy.

437
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
Yeah.

438
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,080
But even then, you train...

439
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,080
That might help us practice here a bit.

440
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,080
Absolutely.

441
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,080
So, training is one thing that absolutely I agree.

442
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,080
Every centre needs training.

443
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,080
And you had mentioned that if this centre offered it, maybe more people would get treatment

444
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
rather than going to the higher...

445
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
Yeah, that could be.

446
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:10,080
So, then, does that mean you would also want more technology for the facility itself?

447
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,080
For example, to do treatment you also need the tools and the supplies.

448
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,080
Yeah, yeah.

449
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,080
Would you...

450
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
Is that something also that would be worth investing in?

451
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,080
Getting that in the CHC?

452
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,080
Yeah.

453
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,080
Such as treatment, like cryotherapy, lean...

454
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,080
Yeah, basic therapy can be given, I think.

455
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,080
Okay.

456
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,080
Okay.

457
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:35,080
And are you familiar with the Foxy Good Clinical Practice recommendations, the GCPR recommendations?

458
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,080
I can just give you one.

459
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,080
Yeah.

460
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:42,080
We just asked so that we can give this, but it's basically a...

461
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,080
for cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccine.

462
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,080
Yeah, I'm aware of this.

463
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,080
You are aware of this.

464
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,080
Yes.

465
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,080
But would you like to keep this?

466
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,080
It's for you if you would like it.

467
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,080
Yeah.

468
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,080
Perfect.

469
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,080
Can I?

470
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,080
Yeah, absolutely, please.

471
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,080
Okay, thank you.

472
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,080
Yeah.

473
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:11,080
And then we're just getting into our final questions.

474
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:17,080
So, this is more hypothetical, but let's say there was a cervical cancer prevention center

475
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,080
that had all the equipment and trained personnel to conduct screening and follow-up.

476
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,080
If that was available, would you use the center to either refer patients or conduct screening

477
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,080
and follow-up yourself?

478
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,080
Yeah, sure.

479
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,080
Okay.

480
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,080
I'm going to use it.

481
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,080
Any reason you feel that some providers would not use it?

482
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,080
I don't think so.

483
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,080
Okay.

484
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,080
That's good to know.

485
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:42,080
So, then finally, and take your time to think about this, is there anything else you would

486
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,080
like to share about your experiences with cervical cancer that we haven't discussed?

487
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,080
Whether it's screening or follow-up or treatment, anything?

488
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,080
I've seen some two or three cervical cancer patients at one stage, so I really feel bad

489
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,080
for them.

490
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,080
So, had their access to the treatment or prevention earlier, probably they would have survived.

491
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,080
Because some few patients come here regularly for IV fluid center, feel very bad seeing them.

492
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,080
And how do you feel they could have gotten it earlier?

493
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,080
And what could they have done to maybe detect it at an earlier stage?

494
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,080
Like, one of them told me that she neglected her symptoms.

495
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,080
So, in spite of the doctor repeatedly telling her she didn't warrant it to take the treatment.

496
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,080
I see.

497
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,080
So, she feels bad about it now.

498
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,080
And why do you think she neglected her treatment?

499
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,080
Or did she say anything about why she neglected her symptoms?

500
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,080
Probably casual attitude, right?

501
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,080
Yeah, yeah.

502
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,080
And is that common, do you feel, in the patients you see?

503
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,080
Yeah, it might be common, yeah.

504
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,080
Okay.

505
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,080
So, that's very interesting, being casual.

506
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,080
Okay, I think, anything, sorry, anything else before I end?

507
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,080
Nothing.

508
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,080
Okay.

509
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,080
So, I think with that, that's all the information.

510
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,080
Thank you so much for everything you've shared.

511
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,080
Thank you.

512
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,080
I'm going to end the recording now, but this was very helpful.

513
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,080
Sorry, I'm just...

514
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,080
Please have your day.

515
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,080
Oh, yeah.

516
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,080
No worries.

517
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
No worries.
