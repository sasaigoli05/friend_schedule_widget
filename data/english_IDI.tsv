0	15060	IDI for so the first question I just like to start off by learning a little more about you
15060	20160	and your work so can you tell me about your role and typical responsibilities in your health care
20160	42720	facility. My role as obstetrician is to help the patients who come for ANC checkup to see that the pregnancy is carried out safely throughout and they have a safe confinement and as a gynecologist to cater for any health care issues of the other women in the reproductive or post reproductive age.
43720	46120	Perfect. And how long have you been in this position?
46120	49320	In this present working place, I have been here since four years.
49620	53100	Okay. And what types of patients do you most often see?
53860	59180	Most often I see ANC patients. Okay. And of course patients in the reproductive age group.
59460	65980	Okay. And what types of health issues, so in your case women's health issues, do you most commonly see?
67440	73820	Apart from agrarian cancer checkup, women do come to me with white discharge and irregular bleeding.
73820	82460	I see. And where does cervical cancer screening fall on that list of health issues that women come with?
83160	83900	I didn't get you.
84560	89260	So do women also come with cervical cancer or symptoms of cervical cancer?
89260	90340	Yeah, they do come with the symptoms.
90340	99560	And what types of services do you provide for the health issues you said? Whether it's white discharge or anything like that, what treatment do you offer them?
100060	109860	First I just examine them and to see. If there's an infection, I do treat them locally. And if the symptoms do persist, I just offer them a screening for cancer.
110260	112080	Even otherwise regularly, I do offer them a screening.
112080	121920	Okay. And now going a little bit more into cervical cancer specifically, are you involved in cervical cancer screening and treatment?
122380	123040	Yeah, I'm involved.
123040	132700	Okay. And how much did your medical training cover cervical cancer? Was it a lot in your training or did you learn more through experience?
133560	134920	It was more with experience only.
135060	135260	Okay.
135420	136880	You mean to say in the college days.
137080	137280	Yeah.
137480	138740	Yeah, not much exposure there.
138820	146180	Okay. Was there any formal continued medical education that helped in learning more or it was mostly just experience?
146180	149900	Yeah, yeah, of course. Country medical education. We attend CME and other things.
149960	150200	Okay.
150500	150960	They do help.
151280	161640	Wonderful. So, with that being said, are you aware of any formal training opportunities like CME for cervical cancer specifically, cervical cancer screening?
162440	164880	Any particular CME training for that?
164880	165460	Training, yeah.
165680	167540	No, I haven't done any particular training for that.
167540	175500	Okay. So, would you say that these types of trainings about cervical cancer are accessible for you or your colleagues or they're not as common?
175500	176580	They're accessible.
176860	177440	They're accessible.
177440	186580	They're accessible. Okay. Wonderful. So, getting more into the prevention and treatment, do you provide any prevention or treatment services for cervical cancer?
188480	195400	Prevention, actually screening will be done. That's a sort of prevention only because early detection will help the treatment to prevent the cancer.
195620	195940	Absolutely.
196140	201220	And recently the government is initiating a drive to vaccinate all the girls aged from 9 to 14.
201380	201560	Yeah.
201820	203560	So, that needs to be implemented yet.
203700	204080	Absolutely.
204080	209040	Even otherwise, if any patients are willing, I do advise them to go for other places to get the vaccine done.
209220	210820	Okay. And any treatment?
212160	220000	Treatment in earlier I used to practice in a private training. They used to give this, I used to do biopsy and cryotherapy once or twice have done.
220220	220520	Okay.
220660	221520	Not much than that.
221660	222360	But not here?
222640	223960	Not here. Here it's not done.
223960	230280	So, for screening specifically, is it offered to everyone or only if they have symptoms?
230920	232220	Screening I do offer for everyone.
232380	232640	Okay.
232640	234520	But not all undergo screening.
234640	234820	Yeah.
234820	234840	Yeah.
235400	236320	That makes sense.
236320	245020	And so, once they come to you for screening, what do the next steps look like? Whether they're negative or positive, what happens next?
245020	257620	If they're negative, then as they get it repeated for every year for three years, three consecutive years. Then if they're negative, it's fine. In case if they're positive, then I just refer them to higher symptoms.
257880	258480	Higher symptoms.
258480	259360	Medical quality here.
259360	267780	I see. I see. Got it. And do you only really screen when they show symptoms or do you screen regular, routinely?
269120	276020	Actually, patients do come to when they have symptoms. Otherwise, even if they offer, they won't be willing to get it screened.
276120	283700	Yeah. Got it. So, how many women who screen positive come back for follow-up or go to the next level for follow-up?
285180	288020	So far, I haven't seen any patient coming back to me.
288020	289020	Okay. No patients.
289020	290300	No one has come.
290480	293400	So, do you feel that enough women are getting follow-up or no?
294760	296720	Enough women, they are not getting follow-up, I think.
296820	298660	Okay. Okay. Got it.
298820	303720	So, once their symptoms fade off, then probably they'll be happy sitting at home.
303880	304540	I see. Don't come back.
304760	307840	Okay. And if their symptoms don't fade off, then you think...
307840	308860	Then they do come.
309060	309500	They do come.
309500	309820	They do come.
309880	311860	They come back to you or they go to the next...
311860	314520	They do come to me and then I advise them to go to the higher center.
314540	315120	Higher center.
315120	320180	And I don't know if you know this, but do they generally end up going to the higher center
320180	321940	or do you feel they don't end up going?
323020	325260	Some might go. Some will go. Some won't.
325440	326300	Okay. Okay.
326300	331020	Any amount or rate you feel or just generally some go, some don't go?
331500	333700	Like any number of women, you think 50 or so?
333700	334760	I'm not sure. I'm not sure.
334880	335300	No worries.
335300	340160	Is there anything that you do that will increase the chances of a woman following up?
340360	343940	Is there anything you say to them or do for them that you think will help them go?
344420	346900	I think a regular follow-up with Asha Varkas might help.
347200	348040	Okay. Okay.
348460	349520	So, same question.
349860	354760	Is there anything you would like to do or would be helpful to improve screening and follow-up amongst women?
355440	356980	I think health education.
357280	357600	Okay.
357860	359420	Regular health education monthly.
360420	360980	Got it.
361360	363020	And awareness might help.
363020	368060	And any ways you feel the best way to do that, awareness or health education?
368200	371500	Is there any specific way to increase the education?
371980	372800	Increase education.
375280	381220	I think the Asha Varkas, they will be the best persons to motivate women to ask them to come to me.
381340	382540	So that I can educate them.
382580	384780	Otherwise, I can't go to their door and ask them to come.
385100	387100	So, obviously, when they come here, I can educate them.
387600	387920	I see.
388080	390900	So, you think that it's important for women to come to the stage?
390900	392020	To come to the facility.
392020	392660	To come to the facility.
392840	393160	I see.
393980	395260	That makes a lot of sense.
399260	399620	Okay.
399740	407860	And then the next question is going into learning more about the CHC specifically and how the CHC works with cervical cancer treatment.
407860	418240	So, the first question is just how do you receive the equipment and supplies such as the pap smear kits or the colposcopy tools, whatever you might use.
418340	421380	How do you receive them to conduct the screening and follow-up?
421460	424900	Is it like a government gives you or what is the process?
425040	426640	At present only, I am doing VIA.
427040	427260	Okay.
427260	428640	So, usually, especially with acetic acid.
428760	428980	Okay.
429060	431040	So, corpus commandos is not available here.
431060	431340	Okay.
431560	431760	Okay.
431860	433080	So, how do you receive the VIA?
433100	433900	Usually, through the government.
434260	434580	Government.
434860	437260	And is everyone trained on the VIA or just?
437420	438000	No, not.
438400	439140	VIA, not.
439280	440940	I don't think everyone is trained.
441180	441420	Okay.
441680	443960	So, just you as the gynecologist can do VIA?
444100	445360	The nursing staff or anything?
445360	446060	Nursing staff, yeah.
446180	447320	If I train them, they can do.
447500	447680	Okay.
447680	449060	They do assistment, they can do.
449280	449560	Okay.
449680	450900	But they don't, okay, got it.
451120	453880	So, comes from the government, got it.
453960	454060	Yeah.
454120	458660	And then, do you have to work with any pathology or lab services then?
458740	462860	But if you don't do biopsy or pap smears, is there anything else you have to send to the lab?
462940	466820	Yeah, our lab technician, she doesn't study the smear.
467040	467260	Okay.
467260	469940	So, we have to send the smear to my medical college.
470100	470360	Okay.
470360	473120	So, you do do the smear here, the pap smear?
473240	473940	Sometimes I do.
474160	474380	Okay.
474640	477820	And what, how do you decide if you'll do pap smear or if you'll do VIA?
478460	481300	Like, which one do you choose based on what options?
481580	483480	Actually, VIA is much easier to do.
483560	483760	Yeah.
483860	486720	And it carries a lot more convenience.
487040	487300	Okay.
487420	489620	So, if people are willing for pap smear, then I'll do that.
489720	489980	Okay.
490120	491480	But otherwise, normally you do?
491480	492120	Normally, VIA.
492260	492600	VIA.
492800	493000	Okay.
493540	496680	And is it a cost difference or anything or it's the same?
496680	499520	That pap smears and VIA are equally accessible?
499520	500520	Yeah.
500520	502280	More than cost difference, it's the convenience.
502280	503280	Okay.
503280	506280	Like, perhaps you have to take the smear, then the labor attendants into the lab.
506280	507280	Yeah.
507280	508280	Then you have to follow it up.
508280	509280	Yeah.
509280	510280	I see.
510280	518040	So, actually based on that, because you're absolutely correct, that it takes some time
518040	520040	when you send to the lab and you get results.
520040	524040	So, does that time, does that get extended and women stop following up?
524040	524800	Yeah, yeah.
524800	525800	Maybe.
525800	526800	That happens sometimes.
526800	527800	Okay.
527800	529800	So, there's a time gap in between the pathology services.
529800	530800	Yeah, there's a time gap.
530800	531800	Okay.
531800	532800	Got it.
532800	537300	So, if you send a smear, how long does it take for the report to come back?
537300	539560	A few days, maybe.
539560	540040	Okay.
540040	540860	A few days.
540860	541860	Got it.
542940	549160	But, do you think the time affects the woman's willingness to get treated?
549480	551800	Like, longer times affect whether women will come back?
551800	552940	Not all, but some.
552940	553940	Yeah.
553940	554940	Yeah.
554940	555940	Makes sense.
555940	556940	Absolutely.
556940	559940	So, these questions are a bit repetitive, the next ones, but I'll just ask them.
559940	564940	Do you have the resources here to conduct treatment services for HPV infection or precancerous
564940	567940	lesions, such as cryotherapy, LEAP or thermal ablation?
567940	569940	We don't have any resources.
569940	570940	No.
570940	571940	Yes.
571940	576180	And, same question, a little repetitive, is resources to conduct treatment services for
576180	578940	cervical cancer, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy?
578940	579940	No.
579940	582940	I think, in this aspect, we need to be trained.
582940	583940	Training is necessary.
583940	584940	Absolutely.
584940	585940	So, actually, that's a good segue.
585940	591940	Next question is, do you feel that your facility has, the CHC has enough medical personnel,
591940	596940	so nurses, doctors, staff, trained to work on preventing and treating cervical cancer?
596940	599940	At present, we're getting the staff recently due to transfer, so I've got a few more staff.
599940	600940	Okay.
600940	602940	So, I think now we may be able to do that.
602940	603940	I see.
603940	605940	But, what about the training instead of the number of people?
605940	606940	Training is necessary.
606940	607940	Absolutely necessary.
607940	608940	Absolutely.
608940	623940	licence
623940	625940	The story is happening in Victoria.
625940	626940	Yes.
626940	627940	Absolutely.
627940	633160	To what about the labor and the mental elements by KJ that we are doing doing something like
633160	634160	you that we have them as well.
634160	635260	I'm saying it doesn't matter.
635260	636260	Yes.
636260	650120	just go back sorry so we were just talking a little bit about training so
650120	654740	if you have any more thoughts on what does more training look like where do
654740	658700	you want to see more training whether it's it's for screening treatment or
658700	663320	just knowledge what does training look like I think training should be more
663320	668780	regarding knowledge and the treatment for screening anybody can do yeah screening
668780	672080	everyone can if we can do for treatment every time they need to go to higher
672080	675500	center so that will be difficult for the local local it's yeah so if the
675500	679820	difference might available locally certainly more helpful I think absolutely
679820	683420	that makes that makes sense so do you think that means that they you need more
683420	689240	gynecologists or you need more training for like nurses and staff so available
689240	692420	gynecologists and nurses can be trained if they're trained well enough that will be
692420	700220	more helpful okay okay so next question is going more into the CHC because you
700220	703460	must have to work with other facilities like you said you refer them to the
703460	708980	higher center so how would how does the referral process work between the CHC and
708980	713300	yourself and the higher centers or even the PHC ASHA workers how do you
713300	718740	communicate with them in case if I find a patient positive like I'll refer a
718740	722880	direct to the medical college for treatment and in case if I if ASHA knows
722880	726540	her well then I can follow her up with sending the ASHA like I'll collect the ASHA's number
726540	730680	they'll have it they'll see to it that she's getting her treatment there regularly
730680	734340	otherwise sometimes there are chances of missing a patient yeah if they're not from
734340	739680	this local area they're from other places I obviously do okay so the ASHA worker you
739680	743520	contact the ASHA worker who follows up with the patient on whether the patient is
743520	746460	getting their treatment from the higher center yeah so it's like us like a
746460	754200	multiple people multiple people I see and what about between the the yourself and the higher
754200	758280	center is there how do you communicate and contact the higher center oh obviously with
758280	763020	the written notes only I can just write my findings and add them to the needful I see so
763020	767220	sometimes getting the feedback will be difficult directly from them I see so the written notes
767220	771180	go through the patient or you send it directly to the higher center yeah unless I know the doctor
771180	776100	there okay so if there are many acquaintances or friends I can follow them up otherwise I'll just
776100	782100	have to get the help of the ASHA workers of the ASHA workers so with that being said then is is it
782100	788220	difficult to get the is it difficult to get the patient to the higher center
788220	793140	occasionally or is that mostly the ASHA workers job to see that the patient goes to
793140	796660	the no no sometimes if there is a absolute necessity the patients will
796660	801000	voluntarily go into the higher center only follow-up needs to be done okay though not all
801000	806520	maybe really few will definitely go okay got it and then in order to for you to keep track of the
806520	815100	patients you contact the ASHA workers so what tends to what works well in between working with
815100	820020	the ASHA workers and the higher set the higher center like how do you make sure the process is smooth
820020	826020	like ASHA workers act like mediators so the they are in good contact with the patient since they
826020	834420	said locally I see so I think they're the better process to convince them okay makes sense and so
834420	841500	do you feel there's a shared understanding so between the all the levels ASHA worker PHC CHC of
841500	847620	cervical care and do they all you know do they all give importance to cervical cancer or do you feel
847620	853860	it's it's different on different not not the same not the same okay so in what ways do you think it's
853860	860380	different at which level is it is it more maybe more important and at which levels is maybe it's
860380	868620	given less importance for cervical cancer if that makes sense like I did first the patient I need to
868620	873540	understand the seriousness of her symptoms yeah then she needs the ASHA worker needs to bring her here
873540	881220	then I get her exam and she had to take her for follow then get her treated so it's a long process
881220	886320	yeah so there will anyway chances of missing the patient in between or the treatment may be discontinued
886320	893220	I see so I think equally healthy education is always equally important so we have to create an
893220	898140	awareness among the women who are in the reproductive age group and let them understand the importance of
898140	902140	of the cervical cancer screening so then only we can screen and send them
902140	911140	I see absolutely and so sorry back to the shared understanding do you feel that the that
911140	917880	cervical cancer is given importance within the healthcare system so for example at the PHC or the CHC or the
917880	922640	higher center is it given more importance if a patient goes to the higher center versus if they go to the
922640	928080	PHC or you think they are all the levels give cervical cancer equal importance that it's an important
928080	939080	higher center I guess so based on this final on this part is what are some challenges that you're that the
939080	945080	patients face when they have to go to a different level of care so the higher center or even speak to
945080	952080	their ASHA what some issues they might have going to the higher center access will be the main issue I think because in a local
952080	963080	healthcare center like that the doctors and staff are easily accessible for them so in a higher center they'll be they're not knowing where to go whom to approach so that difficulty they might face
963080	977080	I see and if you don't mind expanding a little more on what access so because I'm not entirely familiar with the higher center so what makes it difficult to access the center is it just they're not familiar or it's busy things like that
977080	988080	such a big hospital they're not familiar with whom to contact whom not to and many won't be educated also so in a big hospital they find difficult to find the right person to contact the right person
988080	994080	I see even if you refer them and you give them a referral to the higher center they'll struggle to find the
994080	1006080	sometimes they might struggle not all but some uneducated people and all they might struggle I see generally what are they supposed to do so when you refer them to the higher center what is the patient supposed to do when they go there are they supposed to find the
1006080	1013080	are they supposed to find the doctor themselves or you give them the doctor's name or how does it work we don't usually give them a doctor's name because the unit
1013080	1021080	you mentioned only there are separate units yeah so each day will be assigned to a different unit so we won't be knowing which unit will be working that particular day I see
1021080	1031080	so you just ask them to go to the OPD and give them the FLS name okay okay so they have to approach the doctor themselves okay I see so do you feel that makes it more difficult for them
1031080	1043080	maybe difficult sometimes okay versus in the CHC because this is the community do you feel feel the CHC makes it easier for them to to come in and get treatment versus the higher
1043080	1058080	center yeah this might be a bit easier compared to that and why why is that why because this setup will be closer to the place where they reside and there the people will be more accessible to them as I said earlier and the cost of traveling community is more accessible to them
1058080	1065080	as I said earlier and the cost of traveling commuting and that will be saved absolutely and also time
1065080	1086080	yeah that makes sense actually that's a good into my next question is are there any societal or cultural factors that impact whether women follow up on survival cancer care so anything society's things or cultural that stops them from seeking care or changes how they seek care I don't think so okay okay so
1086080	1093080	maybe like education awareness you had mentioned yeah but anything like family
1093080	1099080	support perspectives anything like social that changes their mind social like lower
1099080	1113080	social economic curve people might find it difficult because husbands many times they won't be drunk or they won't support their family so women have to earn themselves they have to look after their families so sometimes they might find it difficult otherwise no other cultural
1113080	1120080	intelligence I think okay only social economic maybe okay so there's no cultural perspective against cervical cancer you feel in what
1120080	1128080	cultural perspective just if if women are scared some people are scared of the word cancer so some women don't pursue treatment for that reason but I don't if only if you feel like it all depends on how you convince them like we don't put the word cancer directly into their head I just tell you that we are getting a screening test done I see not necessarily that patient should have had the cancer
1128080	1135080	okay just a screen test to find it out okay so that words might put some solace into them and they might be good okay we will need to go
1135080	1142080	got it so what about financial constraints do you feel the finances will change whether or not they follow up on care
1142080	1159080	yeah definitely okay is treatment expensive treatment in a government hospital is not expensive okay so then how come finances will impact just because it's still too expensive finance in the sense as i said
1159080	1161080	Is treatment expensive?
1161080	1165080	Treatment in government hospitals is not expensive.
1165080	1169080	So then how come finances will impact? Just because it's still too expensive?
1169080	1175080	Finance in the sense, as I said, in many households women will be working both outside and inside the home.
1175080	1180080	So one day going for treatment again, that day's expense will be...
1180080	1184080	They have to bed on the hunter. They won't be able to go to the work also.
1184080	1190080	So if they sit at home and go for treatment for a couple of days, then the family will be difficult.
1190080	1192080	That way it will be affected.
1192080	1195080	I see. So it's more about the expenses that are missing.
1195080	1196080	That's missing, yeah.
1196080	1197080	I understand.
1197080	1199080	I mean they won't be able to earn that amount for that particular day.
1199080	1201080	I understand. Got it.
1201080	1208080	And what about transportation? So reaching the facility to get the care, does that become...
1208080	1213080	Transportation at present, due to Siddhra Mai's government, all buses, they take the women free only.
1213080	1214080	Oh.
1214080	1215080	So transportation won't be...
1215080	1219080	Okay. So you feel that transporting to the higher centre is...
1219080	1220080	It's not a problem.
1220080	1224080	Okay, got it. How close is the higher centre to the CHC?
1224080	1229080	To this place around 15 kilometres, I guess. 15, 20 kilometres. 15 maybe.
1229080	1231080	Okay, wow. So that's...
1231080	1232080	15, 20, yeah.
1232080	1233080	Yeah.
1233080	1234080	Women are willing to make the...
1234080	1235080	Yeah.
1235080	1238080	Okay. So there's no issues in them, like, wanting to go.
1238080	1239080	No issues.
1239080	1241080	Just the financial thing becomes...
1241080	1243080	Yeah, only the financial thing becomes interesting.
1243080	1244080	I see.
1244080	1249080	So, and you mentioned this as well, but does the way that healthcare providers, like medical
1249080	1254080	providers like yourself, speak to the patients and speak about cervical cancer impact whether
1254080	1256080	or not they choose to follow up on care?
1256080	1257080	Yeah, definitely.
1257080	1258080	Okay.
1258080	1259080	And how so?
1259080	1262080	How so, like, we have to let them...
1262080	1266080	We have to make them be aware of the health issues they are facing.
1266080	1267080	Mm-hm.
1267080	1274080	And, like, since cervical cancer is a preventable one, we have to make them realize that treatment
1274080	1276080	prevention is equally important.
1276080	1277080	Mm-hm.
1277080	1280080	And so, if they are at good health, they can take care of their family well.
1280080	1283080	So you have to put that concept into their mind.
1283080	1284080	Mm-hm.
1284080	1285080	Got it.
1285080	1290080	So, compared to how we are speaking to women today and now, is there any way to improve
1290080	1294080	the way that we speak to them so that they will follow up on care?
1294080	1295080	Sorry.
1295080	1296080	I didn't...
1296080	1297080	Sorry, I didn't...
1297080	1301080	Any improvements we can make to encourage them to follow up on care when we speak to
1301080	1302080	them?
1302080	1303080	Yeah.
1303080	1307080	Whether it's, you said awareness, so that one I noted down, increasing awareness, anything
1307080	1311080	else, whether it's consolation, counselling, anything like that?
1311080	1312080	Yeah, you think...
1312080	1313080	Counseling might help.
1313080	1314080	Okay.
1314080	1315080	Counseling and regular screening camps.
1315080	1316080	Mm-hm.
1316080	1317080	Once in three months, once in six months.
1317080	1318080	That might help.
1318080	1319080	Okay.
1319080	1322080	So, once one who I miss, they will come to a screening for the next camp.
1322080	1323080	Mm-hm.
1323080	1324080	Screening at least twice a year.
1324080	1325080	Mm-hm.
1325080	1326080	That might help.
1326080	1327080	Okay.
1327080	1328080	Regular screening in all villages.
1328080	1329080	Yeah.
1329080	1330080	Regular screening.
1330080	1331080	Wonderful.
1331080	1337080	So, then we're nearing the end, but this is more looking into the future and take your time
1337080	1342080	to think about it, but if you were able to make one or two changes to improve cervical
1342080	1350080	cancer screening in your facility or in the CSC or in this district, what would they be?
1350080	1356080	One thing is a mandatory vaccination for all girls, teenage girls.
1356080	1358080	Then compassive screening.
1358080	1360080	That's the only thing I would recommend.
1360080	1361080	Okay.
1361080	1365080	So, when there's mass screening and it's free of cost, then obviously if one woman goes,
1365080	1367080	other women will follow her.
1367080	1369080	And what is the best way to do that?
1369080	1373080	How do you get these women to these mass screenings?
1373080	1376080	Is it holding them in the CSC or going into the community?
1376080	1378080	How do you suggest doing it?
1378080	1380080	Going into the community can be done through ASHA workers.
1380080	1382080	They have to get their patients.
1382080	1383080	I see.
1383080	1387080	So, but ASHA workers are not trained on cervical cancer screening.
1387080	1388080	They're not trained.
1388080	1389080	Right.
1389080	1394080	So, instead do you suggest training them or bringing them, having them bring the patients to
1394080	1395080	the...
1395080	1396080	Let them bring the patients.
1396080	1397080	That will be better.
1397080	1398080	So, and bring them to the CSC.
1398080	1399080	The CSC.
1399080	1400080	Right.
1400080	1404080	Because even the two houses, they won't be able to screen them there.
1404080	1405080	That won't be possible.
1405080	1406080	Yeah.
1406080	1409080	So, then what about changes to improve follow-up and treatment?
1409080	1414080	So, not screening, but following up and making sure women, because a lot of women end
1414080	1417080	up not, you know, you had mentioned not all women go to the higher center.
1417080	1420080	So, how can we improve and make sure they go to the higher center?
1420080	1426080	I think once we screen a certain list of patients, we have to note down their attention number.
1426080	1429080	And once you come positive, you can follow them up.
1429080	1432080	By regular health staff or I can call them myself.
1432080	1433080	I see.
1433080	1438080	Because a few patients around my working place, it won't be much difficult, I think.
1438080	1439080	Yeah.
1439080	1440080	Got it.
1440080	1445080	And so, you feel that, you feel that that will help if the doctor speaks to them directly,
1445080	1446080	that it will have a stronger...
1446080	1447080	Yeah.
1447080	1448080	It will help them.
1448080	1449080	It will boost their confidence.
1449080	1450080	I see.
1450080	1451080	Got it.
1451080	1459080	And any innovation that you feel could significantly improve patient outcomes in the CHC?
1459080	1465080	So, whether it's any technology or education that would make cervical cancer screening and
1465080	1466080	treatment better here.
1466080	1472080	But I think all, like I said, as a working gynecologist here, I think in Mysore there
1472080	1476080	are many gynecologists, but we are made to concentrate more on ANCs.
1476080	1477080	Yeah.
1477080	1478080	Like antenatal obstetricians.
1478080	1479080	Yeah.
1479080	1481080	We concentrate more on obstetrics rather than gynecology.
1481080	1485080	So, I think we, people need regular training in treatment.
1485080	1486080	Yes.
1486080	1487080	Like cryotherapy.
1487080	1488080	Yeah.
1488080	1489080	But even then, you train...
1489080	1491080	That might help us practice here a bit.
1491080	1492080	Absolutely.
1492080	1496080	So, training is one thing that absolutely I agree.
1496080	1497080	Every centre needs training.
1497080	1501080	And you had mentioned that if this centre offered it, maybe more people would get treatment
1501080	1502080	rather than going to the higher...
1502080	1503080	Yeah, that could be.
1503080	1510080	So, then, does that mean you would also want more technology for the facility itself?
1510080	1514080	For example, to do treatment you also need the tools and the supplies.
1514080	1515080	Yeah, yeah.
1515080	1516080	Would you...
1516080	1518080	Is that something also that would be worth investing in?
1518080	1519080	Getting that in the CHC?
1519080	1520080	Yeah.
1520080	1521080	Such as treatment, like cryotherapy, lean...
1521080	1522080	Yeah, basic therapy can be given, I think.
1522080	1523080	Okay.
1523080	1524080	Okay.
1524080	1535080	And are you familiar with the Foxy Good Clinical Practice recommendations, the GCPR recommendations?
1535080	1536080	I can just give you one.
1536080	1537080	Yeah.
1537080	1542080	We just asked so that we can give this, but it's basically a...
1542080	1543080	for cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccine.
1543080	1544080	Yeah, I'm aware of this.
1544080	1545080	You are aware of this.
1545080	1546080	Yes.
1546080	1547080	But would you like to keep this?
1547080	1549080	It's for you if you would like it.
1549080	1550080	Yeah.
1550080	1551080	Perfect.
1551080	1552080	Can I?
1552080	1553080	Yeah, absolutely, please.
1553080	1554080	Okay, thank you.
1554080	1555080	Yeah.
1555080	1571080	And then we're just getting into our final questions.
1571080	1577080	So, this is more hypothetical, but let's say there was a cervical cancer prevention center
1577080	1582080	that had all the equipment and trained personnel to conduct screening and follow-up.
1582080	1587080	If that was available, would you use the center to either refer patients or conduct screening
1587080	1588080	and follow-up yourself?
1588080	1589080	Yeah, sure.
1589080	1590080	Okay.
1590080	1591080	I'm going to use it.
1591080	1594080	Any reason you feel that some providers would not use it?
1594080	1595080	I don't think so.
1595080	1596080	Okay.
1596080	1597080	That's good to know.
1597080	1602080	So, then finally, and take your time to think about this, is there anything else you would
1602080	1606080	like to share about your experiences with cervical cancer that we haven't discussed?
1606080	1610080	Whether it's screening or follow-up or treatment, anything?
1610080	1615080	I've seen some two or three cervical cancer patients at one stage, so I really feel bad
1615080	1616080	for them.
1616080	1620080	So, had their access to the treatment or prevention earlier, probably they would have survived.
1620080	1626080	Because some few patients come here regularly for IV fluid center, feel very bad seeing them.
1626080	1629080	And how do you feel they could have gotten it earlier?
1629080	1633080	And what could they have done to maybe detect it at an earlier stage?
1633080	1635080	Like, one of them told me that she neglected her symptoms.
1635080	1639080	So, in spite of the doctor repeatedly telling her she didn't warrant it to take the treatment.
1639080	1640080	I see.
1640080	1642080	So, she feels bad about it now.
1642080	1644080	And why do you think she neglected her treatment?
1644080	1647080	Or did she say anything about why she neglected her symptoms?
1647080	1648080	Probably casual attitude, right?
1648080	1649080	Yeah, yeah.
1649080	1651080	And is that common, do you feel, in the patients you see?
1651080	1653080	Yeah, it might be common, yeah.
1653080	1654080	Okay.
1654080	1658080	So, that's very interesting, being casual.
1658080	1662080	Okay, I think, anything, sorry, anything else before I end?
1662080	1663080	Nothing.
1663080	1664080	Okay.
1664080	1665080	So, I think with that, that's all the information.
1665080	1667080	Thank you so much for everything you've shared.
1667080	1668080	Thank you.
1668080	1670080	I'm going to end the recording now, but this was very helpful.
1670080	1671080	Sorry, I'm just...
1671080	1672080	Please have your day.
1672080	1673080	Oh, yeah.
1673080	1674080	No worries.
1674080	1675080	No worries.
